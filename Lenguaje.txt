The Dropbox software enables users to drop any file into a designated folder. The file is then automatically uploaded to Dropbox's 
cloud-based service and made available to any other of the user's computers and devices that also have the Dropbox software installed,
keeping the file up-to-date on all systems.[74] When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the pieces of
the file that have been changed, whenever possible.[75]

When a file or folder is deleted, users can recover it within 30 days. For Dropbox Plus users, this recovery time can be extended 
to one year, by purchasing an "Extended Version History" add-on.[59]

Dropbox accounts that are not accessed or emails not replied in a year are automatically deleted.[76]

Dropbox also offers a LAN sync feature, where, instead of receiving information and data from the Dropbox servers, computers on the
local network can exchange files directly between each other, potentially significantly improving synchronization speeds.[77]

Originally, the Dropbox servers and computer apps were written in Python.[78] In July 2014, Dropbox began migrating its backend 
infrastructure to Go.[79]

In September 2012, Dropbox's website codebase was rewritten from JavaScript to CoffeeScript.[80]

Dropbox originally used Amazon's S3 storage system to store user files, but between 2014 and 2016 they gradually moved away from Amazon
to use their own hardware, referred to as "Magic Pocket", due to Dropbox's description as "a place where you keep all your stuff, it
doesnâ€™t get lost, and you can always access it".[81] In June 2017, the company announced a major global network expansion, aiming to
increase synchronization speeds while cutting costs. The expansion, starting with 14 cities across 7 countries on 3 continents, adds 
"hundreds of gigabits of Internet connectivity with transit providers (regional and global ISPs), and hundreds of new peering partners 
(where we exchange traffic directly rather than through an ISP)".[82][83][84]

Dropbox uses SSL transfers for synchronization and stores the data via Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption.[85]

The functionality of Dropbox can be integrated into third-party applications through an application programming interface (API).[86]

Dropbox prevents sharing of copyrighted data, by checking the hash of files shared in public folders or between users against a blacklist 
of copyrighted material. This only applies to algo cambie.... jejeje files or folders shared with other users or publicly, and not to files kept in an 
individual's Dropbox folder that are not shared.[87]
